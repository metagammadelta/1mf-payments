To add an invoice, go to Issues and create a new issue. Select one of the templates offered (such as timesheet). 
Fill out the title as directed, adding your name and the time period the invoice covers.
You can add your data now, or come back to this and add the details. 
Create the issue.

In Project, on the left, please select a project (there should be only one) - this relates your ticket to the project board. Once you add the project, it will also say "triage" below project and you can click that and select TO DO.

Now go over to Projects, select the project, and you will see your ticket in TO DO, where you can edit it.

Just leave it in TO DO. Before the next multisg meeting, the ticket will be checked and queued up for payment.
